 * header-sans-using-namespace.h:  make sure student's haven't used
 *   using namespace std;
 * in their project .h files (in global scope).
 * 
 * 220 STAFF: incorporate this into a <Project>'s testing code with
 * a symlink alongside the project test.cpp file:
 *  $ ln -sf ../../../lib/tests/header-sans-using-namespace.h ./
 * and then putting
 *  #include "header-sans-using-namespace.h"
 * immediately _after_ any student project .h files are included in module.
 *
 * STUDENTS:  having 
 *   using namespace X;  // X=std, X=your_own_namespace, ...
 * in the "global scope" of C++ header files is a no, no.  And is
 * counter to best practices.
 *
 * While it won't always break your compile right off the bat, it makes code
 * non-portable and fragile (to see why, look how simple it was to write a test
 * case that snaps poorly written code like a dried twig...).
 *
 * Some guidelines:
 *  - You can always put  using namespace  in C++ source files
 *  - You can put  using namespace  _in_side_of_other_namespaces_
 *    within C++ header files.
 *  - You can always put  using namespace  inside of function
 *    _definitions_, even inside of header files (think template<>
 *    parameterized functions or inline member functions).
